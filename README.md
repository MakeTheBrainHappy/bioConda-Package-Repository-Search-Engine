# bioConda Package Repository Search Engine
A tutorial on how to produce your own bioConda package repository search engine

## Purpose
Currently there is not an efficient method to search <a href="https://anaconda.org/bioconda/repo">bioConda repositories</a> if you are not already familiar with the names of the programs you are looking for. For example, you would easily find the "STAR" alignment package individually; however, may have more difficulty finding all programs availiable in BioConda related to alignment. 

## Required Software
In order to run the Python Script you will need an up-to-date version of Python 3. The code was specifically written in Python 3.7.6. A recommended way to access Python is via the Spyder Console availiable from <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">anaconda.com</a>. Furthermore you will need <a href="https://brew.sh/"> HomeBrew</a> in order to install both <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/installation.html">datasette</a> and <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install">heroku</a>. 

## Required Accounts
You can sign up for a free Heroku account for hosting at <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">heroku.com</a>. The account will come with 550 free dyno hours per month which can cover approx. 70-80% of the month for continous usage. 

## Instructions
Download the python script and open it from your working directory. This is the folder where you want the database file to be saved.
